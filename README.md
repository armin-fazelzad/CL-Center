# CL Center

**Description:**
CL Center is a program designed to control internet usage and monitor CPU usage.

**Features:**
- **Internet:** Shows your internet usage amount and allows you to create a limit. If the user exceeds that limit, it gives them a warning.
- **CPU:** Displays your CPU usage and lets you set three threshold values. If the CPU exceeds any of these numbers, it gives an error sound. You can also choose to shut down your computer if it reaches the third error five times.
